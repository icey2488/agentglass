 * Codex session as a Claude chat would hand `claude --resume` an id it has
 * never seen and fail on the first turn.
 *
 * `source_app` is the stronger signal and is checked first. It is whatever the
 * exporter called itself — Codex's OTel records arrive as `codex_exec` from
 * `codex exec` and `codex_cli_rs` from the TUI, so this matches on the prefix
 * rather than on either exact name. Claude Code's hooks send the project
 * directory's name instead, which is why the model is the fallback and not the
 * primary: it is the only thing a session with an unfamiliar `source_app` has
 * to go on.
 *
 * Defaults to Claude, because that is the overwhelming majority of what this
 * app sees and because being wrong in that direction is the recoverable one:
 * `claude --resume` with a stranger's id reports an unknown session, while
 * `codex exec resume` would be asked to continue a conversation it does not
 * have.

 * for labelling a session that is the overwhelmingly likely answer and being
 * wrong costs a wrong icon. Resuming cannot use a fallback: a Gemini CLI
 * session would be offered as a Claude one and hand `claude --resume` an id it
 * has never seen, which fails on the first turn with nothing to explain it.
 *
 * So Claude is only accepted when something corroborates it. An unresolved
 * model still counts — early Claude Code rows recorded no model, and those are
 * exactly the old sessions worth reaching for — but a session positively
 * identified as somebody else's (Gemini CLI, an OTel exporter this panel cannot
