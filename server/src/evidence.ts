/**
 * Evidence of life for a running tool call.
 *
 * A tool call that has been open for eight minutes is either a long build or a
 * wedged CLI, and the input side cannot tell you which: both look like a
 * PreToolUse with no Post. Every threshold built on elapsed time alone is
 * therefore a guess, and it is wrong in both directions — warn at five minutes
 * and half the warnings are healthy builds, write the pair off at thirty and a
 * genuinely long job vanishes from the fleet while it is still working.
 *
 * So ask a different question: not "how long has this been open" but "when did
 * this session last produce evidence that it is alive". Every source is local
 * and independent of the hook stream, which by definition has gone quiet.
 *
 * ## What the transcript actually does, measured
 *
 * The obvious source is the transcript file, and the obvious rule — "it stopped
 * growing, so the session is hung" — is wrong. Measured against a real Claude
 * Code run with a 43-second Bash call:
 *
 *     command starts   22:18:07
 *     transcript mtime 22:18:10     <- the tool_use record being written
 *     command ends     22:18:50
 *     transcript mtime 22:18:10     <- unchanged for the whole call
 *
 * The CLI writes the call at the start and the result at the end, and nothing
 * in between. A quiet transcript during a tool call is therefore the *normal*
 * state, and a rule built on it would flag every long build as hung — the exact
 * false positive this is meant to retire.
 *
 * That measurement turns the transcript into a different and more useful
 * signal. If it grows *well after* a call opened, the CLI has moved on: the
 * call finished and the Post event never reached us. That is a lost pair, not a
 * hang, and today it is indistinguishable from one for a full thirty minutes.
 *
 * ## What each tool class can be held to
 *
 * A single rule cannot work, because tools differ in what they are expected to
 * leave behind:
 *
 *  - Edit / Write / NotebookEdit name the file they will touch, so that file
 *    not changing is a real absence.
 *  - Bash may write anywhere or nowhere, so movement under its working
 *    directory is evidence *for* life and its absence proves nothing.
 *  - Read / Grep / Glob finish in moments and leave nothing behind, so minutes
 *    of open call with the CLI silent is a genuine stall.
 *  - WebFetch, WebSearch and MCP tools leave nothing local at all.
 *
 * Which is why `unknown` is a first-class answer here and is rendered as one.
 * Claiming a hang we cannot see is how the current thresholds lost trust, and
 * repeating that with better wording would be no improvement.
 *
 * ## No pid, on purpose
 *
 * A `process.kill(pid, 0)` check would settle `lost` vs `stuck` outright for a
 * dead CLI — no more guessing from transcript growth. It isn't here because
 * there is no pid to check: Claude Code's hook payload (read in
 * hooks/send_event.py) carries `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`,
 * `hook_event_name` and friends, never a pid, and the OTel connectors don't add
 * one either. The hook script's OWN pid is briefly visible to it, but that
 * process exits the instant the hook finishes — recording it would make every
 * session read as dead a second after its first event. So this stays
 * evidence-based; a pid column ships if and when Claude Code's hooks start
 * sending one, not by inventing a number that means something else.
